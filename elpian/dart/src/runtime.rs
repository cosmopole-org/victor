//! The Dart runtime driver: owns an Elpian VM instance and services the
//! `dart:*` foundational-library calls the guest makes over the `askHost` seam,
//! applying the two-layer governance on every call.
//!
//! Loop: [`DartRuntime::run`] steps the VM; when it pauses on `askHost` we parse
//! the `{machineId, apiName, payload}` envelope, route `apiName` to a library
//! handler (after the capability + resource checks), and resume the VM with the
//! JSON reply — which becomes the guest call's return value. A thrown Dart error
