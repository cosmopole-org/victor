//! Togglable, host-controlled capabilities for an Elpian VM instance.
//!
//! Every side-effecting thing a guest can reach — logging, GPU submission,
//! module import, the network, the fabricated filesystem, the clock, the random
//! source — is a *capability*. The host can switch each one on or off at any
//! time between turns. When a guest performs an `askHost` whose capability is
//! disabled, the executor does **not** suspend to the host: it short-circuits
//! the call to a typed null, so a guest can keep running deterministically with
//! an interface "unplugged" rather than crashing.
//!
//! Capabilities are derived from the host-API name by [`Capability::for_api`],
//! so the policy is enforced at the single `askHost` seam and automatically
//! covers every present and future API in a family (`net.*`, `fs.*`, …).
