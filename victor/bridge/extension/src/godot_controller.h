/* godot_controller.h — the reflective Godot controller the Elpian VM drives.
 *
 * This is the native half of the bridge (the guest half is
 * `victor/bridge/prelude/godot.dart`). It interprets the uniform "Godot op"
 * protocol — the same paradigm as the CanvasKit/Skia reflective bridge in
 * `web-demo/canvaskit_bridge.js` — so the guest reaches EVERY engine surface
 * by name through ClassDB instead of through per-class wrappers:
 *
 *   {"new": cls, "def": id}                  instantiate any registered class
 *   {"singleton": name, "def": id}           bind any engine singleton
 *   {"tree": true, "def": id}                the SceneTree
 *   {"self": true, "def": id}                the hosting ElpianVM node
 *     ("self"/"tree" may also replace "ref" in the action ops below to
 *      address the hosting node / SceneTree directly, e.g. GD.mount's
 *      {"self": true, "method": "add_child", "args": […]})
 *   {"load": path, "def": id}                load any resource
 *   {"ref", "method", "args"}                call any method (Object::callv)
 *   {"ref", "get"} / {"ref","set","value"}   any property
 *   {"ref", "geti"} / {"ref","seti","value"} any indexed sub-property path
 *   {"ref", "connect", "cb", "flags"}        any signal -> Dart closure
 *   {"ref", "disconnect", "cb"}              undo a connect
 *   {"free": id, "mode": handle|queue|now}   handle / queue_free / memdelete
 *   {"const": "Class.NAME" | "GLOBAL_NAME"}  any class/global constant or enum
 *   {"expr", "names", "values", "base"?}     evaluate any Godot Expression
 *   {"static": "Class.method", "args"}       ClassDB.class_call_static (4.4+)
 *   {"classes": true} / {"classinfo": cls}   full ClassDB introspection
 *   {"audit": true}                          machine-checked coverage report
 *   {"chk": handle}                          containment probe: is handle a
 *                                            Node inside the op's sandbox?
 *   {"grant": handle, "sbx": target}         share a handle with a sandbox
 *
 * plus `godot.batch` (an array of ops -> array of results, ONE seam crossing).
 *
 * ## The multi-VM node sandbox ("__sbx")
 *
 * The Rust VmManager stamps every op forwarded from a sandboxed VM with
 * `"__sbx": <handle of the VM's assigned root node>` (the key is stripped
 * from guest input first — it cannot be forged). Under a non-zero sandbox:
 *
 *   * object references only resolve to Nodes INSIDE the sandbox root's
 *     subtree (root included) — a parent VM can therefore reach into its
 *     children's node trees (they are inside its own sandbox by
 *     construction) while a child can never address outward, even with a
 *     handle it obtained (e.g. from get_parent());
 *   * non-Node objects (resources, refcounted helpers) resolve only if the
 *     handle was created by the same sandbox, was created by an
 *     unrestricted context (host/root — the shared "inter-VM space"), or
 *     was explicitly shared via the "grant" op;
 *   * MainLoop-derived objects (the SceneTree) never resolve;
 *   * {"self"} binds the sandbox root, not the hosting ElpianVM node —
 *     GD.host()/GD.mount() then operate on the VM's own world;
 *   * whole-scene ops are refused: tree / singleton / expr / static;
 *   * script injection is refused: set_script calls, script property
 *     writes, and instantiating/loading Script-derived types.
 *
 * Ops without "__sbx" (the root VM, GDScript callers) are unrestricted.
 *
 * Value marshaling covers every Variant shape both directions (vectors,
 * transforms, colors, rects, packed arrays, dictionaries, node paths, string
 * names, RIDs, objects, callables, signals) via small tagged JSON objects;
 * Objects never cross the seam — 64-bit handles do (guest-chosen ids are
 * positive, host-assigned ids negative, zero never valid).
 *
 * Reentrancy: while the VM is paused inside an op, a call that synchronously
 * fires a connected signal cannot re-enter the VM; bridged Callables therefore
 * QUEUE their invocation (cb id + marshaled args) and the ElpianVM node
 * flushes the queue into `__godotDispatch` at each frame boundary.
